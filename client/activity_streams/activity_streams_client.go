  ActivityStreamsActivityStreamList lists activity streams


Make a GET request to this resource to retrieve the list of
activity streams.

The resulting data structure contains:

    {
        "count": 99,
        "next": null,
        "previous": null,
        "results": [
            ...
        ]
    }

The `count` field indicates the total number of activity streams
found for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to
additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The
`results` list contains zero or more activity stream records.

## Results

Each activity stream data structure includes the following fields:

* `id`: Database ID for this activity stream. (integer)
* `type`: Data type for this activity stream. (choice)
* `url`: URL for this activity stream. (string)
* `related`: Data structure with URLs of related resources. (object)
* `summary_fields`: Data structure with name/description for related resources.  The output for some objects may be limited for performance reasons. (object)
* `timestamp`:  (datetime)
* `operation`: The action taken with respect to the given object(s). (choice)
    - `create`: Entity Created
    - `update`: Entity Updated
    - `delete`: Entity Deleted
    - `associate`: Entity Associated with another Entity
    - `disassociate`: Entity was Disassociated with another Entity
* `changes`: A summary of the new and changed values when an object is created, updated, or deleted (json)
* `object1`: For create, update, and delete events this is the object type that was affected. For associate and disassociate events this is the object type associated or disassociated with object2. (string)
* `object2`: Unpopulated for create, update, and delete events. For associate and disassociate events this is the object type that object1 is being associated with. (string)
* `object_association`: When present, shows the field name of the role or relationship that changed. (field)
* `action_node`: The cluster node the activity took place on. (string)
* `object_type`: When present, shows the model on which the role or relationship was defined. (field)



## Sorting

To specify that activity streams are returned in a particular
order, use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.

    ?order_by=

Prefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:

    ?order_by=-

Multiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with a
comma `,`:

    ?order_by=,some_other_field

## Pagination

Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results
returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve
a particular page of results.

    ?page_size=100&page=2

The `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these query
string parameters automatically.

## Searching

Use the `search` query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search
within all designated text fields of a model.

    ?search=findme

(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search across related fields:

    ?related__search=findme

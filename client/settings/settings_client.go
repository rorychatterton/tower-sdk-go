  SettingsSettingsList lists settings


Make a GET request to this resource to retrieve the list of
settings.

The resulting data structure contains:

    {
        "count": 99,
        "next": null,
        "previous": null,
        "results": [
            ...
        ]
    }

The `count` field indicates the total number of settings
found for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to
additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The
`results` list contains zero or more setting records.

## Results

Each setting data structure includes the following fields:

* `url`:  (string)
* `slug`:  (string)
* `name`:  (string)



## Sorting

To specify that settings are returned in a particular
order, use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.

    ?order_by=name

Prefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:

    ?order_by=-name

Multiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with a
comma `,`:

    ?order_by=name,some_other_field

## Pagination

Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results
returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve
a particular page of results.

    ?page_size=100&page=2

The `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these query
string parameters automatically.

## Searching

Use the `search` query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search
within all designated text fields of a model.

    ?search=findme

(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search across related fields:

    ?related__search=findme

(list, required)
* `PROXY_IP_WHITELIST`: If Tower is behind a reverse proxy/load balancer, use this setting to whitelist the proxy IP addresses from which Tower should trust custom REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS header values. If this setting is an empty list (the default), the headers specified by REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS will be trusted unconditionally&#39;) (list, required)

(list, required)
* `PROXY_IP_WHITELIST`: If Tower is behind a reverse proxy/load balancer, use this setting to whitelist the proxy IP addresses from which Tower should trust custom REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS header values. If this setting is an empty list (the default), the headers specified by REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS will be trusted unconditionally&#39;) (list, required)

Requirements will be downloaded from the primary if the specific role or collection is available there. If the content is not avilable in the primary, or if this field is left blank, it will default to galaxy.ansible.com. (string, default=`""`)
